I have used index.html to call the pokemon.js file.

I have avoided console output and instead displayed the output on html page

The script tag is used in the end at it was not able to get the element p having "id1"

The programs starts with a prompt asking user to choose the following options - 
1)Pokemon Details by name
2)Pokemon name in next Evolution
3)Pokemon Names by Weakness

I have used switch case for this option part

Any other input will alert "Invalid Option!"


---------------------------------------------------------The working of 1)Pokemon Details by name------------------------------------------------


After selecting option as 1

User is prompted to enter pokemon name

This name is then passed to the function getpokemonDetails 

I initiazed a flag isFound to false

I have used for in loop to loop through the pokemon array

At every iteration a conditional if is placed to check if the entered name matches the current iterated name,
if found, the flag isFound is set to true,
and the details of the pokemon is stored in details variable by using the JSON.stringify function as - JSON.stringify(pokemonList.pokemon[x], null, 2)
The details is then displayed on html page using document.getElementById("id1").innerText = details
and by using break it is exited from the loop

if not found, after iterating the whole array
the flag isFound is still false 
and "No such pokemon found" is alerted


---------------------------------------------------------The working of 2)Pokemon name in next Evolution------------------------------------------------


After selecting option as 2

User is prompted to enter pokemon name of next Evolution

This name is then passed to the function getpokemonEvolution

I initiazed a flag anyFound to false
and initiazed pokeArray = [], as null

Two for in loops are used in the nested manner 

Outter loop is for (var x in pokemonList.pokemon), to iterate over the pokemon array

Inner loop as for (var y in pokemonList.pokemon[x].next_evolution) to iterate the next_evolution for each pokemon 

		Note -- The key "next_evolution " array is not present in all the pokemon items, hance following soution is used

			next_evolution array is not present in every pokemonList.pokemon,hence a check is required before entering in the inner loop,
			so that it doesn't returns undefined
			Following statement is used -- if ((pokemonList.pokemon[x]).hasOwnProperty("next_evolution"))


In the inner loop, conditional if statement is used to check if the entered name is in the next_evolution of current iteration as
							if (pokemonList.pokemon[x].next_evolution[y].name == name)
If found, anyFound is set to true
and the pokemon name is pushed to array as pokeArray.push(pokemonList.pokemon[x].name)

After completing whole iteration,
if anyFound is still false, alert "No such pokemon found" is displayed
if anyFound is true, The array of pokemon name is then displayed on html page using document.getElementById("id1").innerText = pokeArray.toString();



---------------------------------------------------------The working of 3)Pokemon Names by Weakness------------------------------------------------


After selecting option as 3

User is prompted to enter Weakness of pokemon

This name is then passed to the function getPokemonByWeakness

I initiazed a flag anyFound to false
and initiazed pokeArray = [], as null

Two for in loops are used in the nested manner 

Outter loop is for (var x in pokemonList.pokemon), to iterate over the pokemon array

Inner loop as for for (var y in pokemonList.pokemon[x].weaknesses) to iterate the weaknesses array for each pokemon 

In the inner loop, conditional if statement is used to check if the entered weakness is in the weakness array of current iteration as
							 if (pokemonList.pokemon[x].weaknesses[y] == weakness)

							if (pokemonList.pokemon[x].next_evolution[y].name == name)

If found, anyFound is set to true
and the pokemon name is pushed to array as pokeArray.push(pokemonList.pokemon[x].name)


After completing whole iteration,
if anyFound is still false, alert "No such pokemon found" is displayed
if anyFound is true, The array of pokemon name is then displayed on html page using document.getElementById("id1").innerText = pokeArray.toString();
